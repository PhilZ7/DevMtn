      <br>Although in my former employment I achieved a good position, being the youngest director sitting in the executive committee of a 4,000-employees company, valuated at close to $1B, had the chance of simultaneously directing 3 departments with a total of 30 employees, being the company's face on court cases, and responsible for returning $70M/y to the bottom line, through strategic measures of multiple kinds. <br><br>Something was missing from it, aiming for bigger things, I started my own company a few years ago, for Physical Security and <em>recently</em> entering into the Cyber Security realm. Want to combine my past skills and impact lives on a positive way.
      <br><br><br>Still maintainig great relationships with people who worked below and above me (some are clients even) I strive to make a difference by protecting lives, digitally, and possibly otherwise.
